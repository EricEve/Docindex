TADS 3 Tool for indexing adv3Lite manual

This is the TADS 3 source code for a utility that generates the index for the TADS 3 library manual.
Compile as a TADS 3 program, copy the compiled program to your main adv3Lite directory, and run it
from there. The html files in the manual/docs directory and extensions/docs directory are then
scanned and the index compiled from them and written out to the manual/docs directory.

Some files (mainly contents pages and the changelog) are deliberately omitted from indexing
